# Shadertoy Projects

This is a collection of my Shadertoy code that I am proud of. My profile can be found [here](https://www.shadertoy.com/profile/?show=shaders).

## Notes:
- For some projects, I was not able to find the date.
- Please forgive (or be amused by) the silly titles when you click on the live versions of the programs.
